# To Do App

#Title: Simple React To-Do Application

#Description:

This project demonstrates a basic To-Do application built with ReactJS, showcasing your understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), React components, hooks (useState, useEffect), and Redux state management.

#Features:

Add tasks: Users can create new tasks by entering text in a field and clicking a button or pressing Enter.
View tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a clear list format.
Delete tasks: Each task has a dedicated button for removal from the list.
(Optional Bonus) Mark tasks as completed: Users can toggle a task's completion status, visually indicating finished items.
(Optional Bonus) Persistent storage: Tasks are saved in local storage (if supported) to persist across page reloads.
Technologies:

#Frontend: HTML, CSS (with or without frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI)
JavaScript (ES6+)
ReactJS with Functional Components and Hooks
Redux for Centralized State Management

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
